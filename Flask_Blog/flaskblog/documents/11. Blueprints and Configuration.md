1. Learn to use flask blueprints
2. Move configuration variables into another file
3. Move creation of application into functions

Split the functionality and files can be to more modular. Moving creations will also allow us to create different instances for testing and production (dev and prod).



# Blueprint

Put all the functions in a single is hard to maintain and upgrade. We can us flask **blueprint** to improve it to a better structure.

For example, we will create an blueprint to combine all the user, posts functionalities.

## Split Directory

We create the folder for ```users```, ```posts```,  and ```main``` which contains the ```home``` and ```about``` page. Then create a ```__init__.py``` under each folder.

Further more, we will create a route and a form(if needed) file under each folder which will only contains the routes and forms regarding to the theme of that folder. Also we will create a ```utils.py``` to hold all the functionalities of that modular.

* **Users package**
  * ```routes.py```: contains routes of users and authentications.
  * ```forms.py```: contains forms of login and register
  * ```utils.py```: contains functionality, for example the methods: ```save_picture``` and ```send_reset_email```



## Create Blueprint

### Import

In the ```routes.py``` under **User package**, we import ```Blueprint``` from ```flask```.

```python
from flask import Blueprint

users = Blueprint('users', __name__)
```



### Split routes - create blueprint

Then we will create route specifically for this users blueprint.

* move ```register```, ```login```, ```logout```, ```account```, ```user_posts```,  ```reset_request```, and ```reset_password``` to blueprint of users

* Replace all the ```app.route``` to ```users.route```

All the others will be the same in the ```posts```  and ```main``` package.1Q	



### Split forms

Similar to the users module, get rid of creating blueprint, we only need to split forms into users and posts packages.

*  Move forms with relate to the ```users``` package and ```posts``` package.



### Register routes

Register it with our application

Replacing the import of route to import from blueprint

```python
from flaskblog import routes
```

to register each of blueprints

```python
from flaskblog.users.routes import users
from flaskbolg.posts.routes import posts
from flaskblog.main.routes import main

app.register_blueprint(users)
app.register_blueprint(posts)
app.register_blueprint(main)
```



### Change all the ```for``` to the URL blueprints

Replace all the ```url_for()``` and ```login_manager``` with function name to the blueprint with the function name.

 For example, 

replace ```url_for('home')``` to ```url_for('main.home')```

replace ```login_manager.login_view = 'login'``` to ```login_manager.login_view = 'users.login'```



# Configurations

This part will move all the configurations (```__init__.py```)into the configuration file ```config.py```.

## Create Config file

Create a ```config.py``` with class ```Config``` to contain all the configurations in ```__init__.py``` regarding to ```app.config```. Change keys to constant variables.

It is better to change all the database info, email info to environment variables in a ```bash``` profile.

After these, import ```Config``` into ```__init__.py```

```python
from flaskblog.config import Config

app.config.from_object(Config)
```



# Create the app

We will move all the creations into a function. This function will take argument with configuration object by a ```Config_class```. But we will exclude the extensions which create the ```login_manager```, ```mail```, and so on. 

```python
def create_app(Config_class=Config):
	# Creation of app
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    # Configuration
    app.config.from_object(Config)
    
   	# Extensions
    db.init_app(app)
    bcrypt.init_app(app)
    login_manager.init_app(app)
    mail.init_app(app)
    
    # Blueprints
    from flaskblog.users.routes import users
    from flaskblog.posts.routes import posts
    from flaskblog.main.routes import main
    agg.register_blueprint(users)
    app.register_blueprint(posts)
    app.register_blueprint(main)
    
    # Return the application
    return app

```

> The reason we exclude the extensions from the creation of app is that we can use them in multiple apps. So generally, we create the extensions on the top of our initial file out of the creation of app. Then include all the extensions into the creation function.



Then we need to replace all the ```app``` variable to ```current_app``` from ```flask``` importing.

```python
from flask import current_app
```

But in the ```run.py```, we will use the ```create_app``` function.

```python
from flaskblog import create_app
app = create_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
	app.run(debug=True)
```



# Structure

After restructuring, the structure of this app will be:
