This is the first document about how to get a flask application up and running and also how to create some basic route.

# Route

## Framework - Flask

### Import

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

```

* ```__name__``` it will be ```__main__``` if we run the python directly. Or it will be the name of the module if we import it.



### Run

#### Run in terminal

To run the application, we need to set the environment variable to the file

* PowerShell

```shell
$env:FLASK_APP = "flaskblog.py"
flask run
```

* CMD

```bash
set FLASK_APP = flaskblog.py
flask run
```

* bash

```bash
export FLASK_APP=hello
flask run
```

#### Run directly

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run(debug=True)
```



### Home page

Add router of home page

> Route: the page where the browser will go to

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"
```



### About Page

```python
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return "<h1>About Page</h1>"
```
