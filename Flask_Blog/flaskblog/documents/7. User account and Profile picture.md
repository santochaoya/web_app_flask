This document is about user account page for users can update account information and upload profile images.

# 

Add a template form for the account page.

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block content %}
    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="media">
            <img class="rounded-circle account-img" src="userimage.jpg">
            <div class="media-body">
                <h2 class="account-heading">{{ current_user.username }}</h2>
                <p class="text-secondary">{{ current_user.email }}</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- FORM HERE -->
    </div>
{% endblock content %}
```



# Profile Image

 The profile image will be set if the user uploaded it. Or it will display a default image.

## Upload Image

We can store our image files in folder **statics**. Set an image file in ```routes.py``` to connect to the file path by ```url_for``` to the local directory.

```python
image_file = url_for('static', filename='profile_pics/' + current_user.image_file)
return renden_templates('account.html', title='Account', image_file=image_file, form=form)
```

* ```image_file``` is the column name in our ```User``` table in the database.

In the templates, replace ```src="userimage.jpg"``` to a dynamic path of image file

```html
<img class="rounded-circle account-img" src="{{ image_file }}">
```

In the ```models.py```, change ```default``` of ```image_file``` to the image filename.

```python
image_file = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, default='2e32b4c96a8d8f10.jpg')
```



## Update User account

### Create update form

We can create a form to update our account information. It is similar to the register form. Except for the information checking whether the email and the username have been changed.

* Compare the current user name to the username in the form:

  ```python
  if username.data != current_user.username:
  	raise ValidationError('Username exists, please choose another one.')
  ```



### Create Form into route

In the ```routes.py```, 

```python
from flaskblog.form import UpdateAccountForm
```



### Create Form Templates

It is similar to the register form. We only keep the **username** and **email** section.



### Setup the update

When submit the form and it is valid, we will update the current username and email. We can comment the current user directly to update the username and email in the database. 

#### Submit the current user

In the ```routes.py```:

```python
if form.validate_on_submit():
	current_user.username = form.username.data
	current_user.email = form.email.data
	db.session.commit()
    flash(f'Your account has been updated', category='success')
    return redirect(url_for('account'))
```



#### Display the current information

```python
elif request.method == 'GET':
    form.username.data = current_user.username
    form.email.data = current_user.email
```



### Update Image

Import file type, we can use ```FileField``` and ```FileAllowed```  is used to restrict the file type the app allowed.

In the ```form.py```

```python
from flask_wtf.file import FileField, FileAllowed

# < -- in the UpdateAccountForm class -- >
picture = FileField('Update Profile Picture', validators=[FileAllowed(['jpg', 'png'])])
```



In the ```routes.py```, we will create a new function for the picture to save the upload image file.

```python
import secrets
import os

def save_picture(form_picture):
    '''get the filename and extension to save the image file. Return the filename.'''
    random_hex = secrets.token_hex(8)
    _, f_ext = os.path.splitext(form_picture.filename)
    picture_filename = random_hex + f_ext
    picture_path = os.path.join(app.root.path, 'static/profile_pics', picture_fn)
    form_picture.save(picture_path)
    return picture_filename

# < -- in the route function -- >
picture_file = save_picture(form.picture.data)
current_user.image_file = picture_file
```

* ```secrets``` module: we will randomize the name of our image because a unrandomized name might be collide.
* ```os.path.split.ext``` : make sure the saving format is the same as it uploaded. Grab the extension from uploaded file. return the filename without extension and the extension.
* ```from_picture``` is the data from the field that user submit.



#### Resize the image

The app will resize the image automatically to 125 pixels to save space of our system. 

* Install package pillow

  ```bash
  pip install pillow
  ```

* In the ```routes.py```

  ```python
  from PIL import Image
  
  # < -- in the save_picture function -- >
  # resize the image
  output_size = (125, 125)
  i = Image.open(form_picture)
  i.thumbnail(output_size)
  i.save(picture_path)
  ```
